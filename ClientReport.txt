REPORT FOR PRODUCT PURCHASE AND LOGIN TESTS






STATUS OF TEST EXECUTION:
The test execution was successful, and the results support moving forward with the production deployment. Below are the details of the executed test cases:
* Login Test: The login functionality was verified, and the system successfully authenticated a new user as expected.
* Product Purchase Test: The product purchase flow was tested, and although an issue was identified with element selection, this has been addressed for future execution.


ISSUES OR FAILURES ENCOUNTERED:
* Product Purchase Test:
   * A CypressError occurred during the product purchase flow when attempting to interact with a page element using cy.type(). The element was either not available or the selector used was incorrect. The failure occurred because the DOM element was not properly found, likely due to a race condition or incorrect selector.
